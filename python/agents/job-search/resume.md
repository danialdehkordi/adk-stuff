PROFILE
PhD Computational Biophysicist turned triple-certified Google Cloud Architect. I translate
complex business and scientific requirements into secure, scalable cloud solutions. Passionate
about empowering organizations, particularly in Healthcare and Life Sciences, to achieve
breakthrough results with Google Cloud.

EXPERIENCE
Consulting Architect, Rackspace Technology – Munich, DE | 2022–Present
• Architected and implemented enterprise-grade security controls derived from Google’s Secure
AI Framework (SAIF), specifically enhancing the secure deployment and operation of
generative AI models within complex cloud and hybrid environments.
• Designed and implemented a production-ready, GCP-based Bazel (remote) build system for
100+ developers across multiple teams, ensuring strict compliance and security.
• Architected and deployed a secure, self-service cloud-based software development
environment, complying with security protocols, reducing developer onboarding time by 65%.
• Optimised Google Distributed Cloud environments for Kubernetes-based applications,
integrating on-premise systems with GCP in hybrid cloud setups to enhance performance for
latency-sensitive workloads.
• Led a team of 5 cloud engineers to develop and implement Kubernetes-based online
applications, serving 60+ users, with a focus on SRE practices.
• Forged relationships with technical stakeholders, compliance oﬃcers, and senior leadership
through product demos and workshops, to advise on architectural decisions and risk
mitigation strategies, including Zero-Trust architectures, enterprise-scale data-loss
prevention, and secure AI deployments.
IT Consultant, Planisware – Munich, DE | 2019–2021
• Led implementation of Planisware project management software, delivering tailored solutions
aligned with client needs for 3 major customers across banking and healthcare industries.
• Managed end-to-end project delivery, from requirements gathering and solution
configuration to testing and user training.
• Coordinated cross-functional teams to ensure on-time, on-budget delivery while customising
software solutions to meet business requirements.
• Oversaw software patch and version upgrade deliveries with minimal client disruption, leading
pre-upgrade assessments and data migration strategies.
PhD Research in Computational Biophysics, Technical University of Munich – Munich, DE |
2017–2021
• Developed and optimised Python-based machine learning applications and workloads on
high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, contributing to advancements in drug design.
• Leveraged HPC clusters, running CUDA-based multi-GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics
simulations, maximising computational eﬃciency.
• Automated data workflows for large-scale biological datasets, streamlining analysis and
visualisation processes.
